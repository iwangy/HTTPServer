# HTTPServer

**Does not work with POSTMAN, use CURL**

For this assignment, you will be building your own HTTP server that implements HTTP/1.1 (RFC2616)

Links to an external site.!

You don't have to read the whole RFC, but you do need to understand the following:

    HTTP Message Structure
    HTTP Request-Line and Status-Line
    HTTP Methods
    HTTP Headers (Content-Type and Content-Length)
    MIME Types
    Status Codes

Create a Github repo named HTTPServer and upload your HTTP Server source code.
